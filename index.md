# Six People to a Group.

## The golden rule for organising conference outings.

Are a bunch of your co-workers and friends at DogeConf? Are you meeting for a quarterly review? Chances are, there are a _lot_ of people in town! And you want to hang out with **all of them**!

## Please: don’t.

**Four people to a table** is a fantastic number: you can get a table anywhere, it’s easy to work around dietary restrictions, and you can interact with _everyone at the table_.

**Six people should be your absolute maximum**. Any more people draws attention to your group, then even _more_ people will join you. Before you know it, you can only eat at McDonald’s or The Olive Garden.

I know, I know: you’re trying to be social by inviting all those people. **You don’t want anyone to feel left out!** But this backfires: there are too many people at the table to even hear, nevermind speak with; non-native English speakers find it harder to keep up; and there will **still** be _someone_ who is left out.

## How to do it:

The next time you’re at a conference and you get four people together: **go get some dinner!** Stop waiting around and at least leave the conference area if you need to stand around on your phone or discuss plans.

If a few stragglers join you, you’re still at six. But that’s the limit: no more!

Now you can socialise with everyone at the table!

_Bon appétit !_
